## for local development

clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/iskaa02/react-weather-app-2.0.0`

run
`$ yarn` to install all the dependencies
get api keys from both the api used  
Weather api: [Open weather api](openweathermap.org/api)

## Roadmap

**Autocomplete Search bar**
i could not apply the auto complete the search bar cause of the API limitations (only 1 request per second), now i'm working on a simple node js server with cities data
you can find the JSON file containing the cities information [here](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz)

**React Native**
after finishing the server, maybe i'll be looking at developing React Native app and try to reusing most of the code.
